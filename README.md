# FlavorReactor: a PioReactor Extension

This is a documentation of [FlavorReactor](https://forum.pioreactor.com/t/flavorreactor-pioreactor-for-larger-volumes/613) by user [Curro99](https://forum.pioreactor.com/u/curro99/summary) on the PioReactor Forum. All credit goes to Curro99.

## What is PioReactor
The [PioReactor](https://pioreactor.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopzRdypVKwPxkhtQ_nTdt420zSTZJ2I4rYK8X71vCv_GeDcW3wb) is an affordable bioreactor built on top of a Raspberry Pi. It allows for budget friendly microfermentations using bacteria, yeast, and algea.

## PioReactor Limitations
While PioReactors are excelent for small scale experiments, it is unable to accomodate volumes larger than 35mL. In addition, sensors such as pH sensors, DO sensors, and CO2 sensors are unable to fit inside the PioReactor. The FlavorReactor was designed and built by Corro99 in 2024 to tackle these limitations. 

## Introducing the FlavorReactor
The FlavorReactor consists of a continuous flow circuit between a PioReactor and a 500mL bioreactor. The PioReactor measures growth rate using its inbuilt optical sensors while the 500mL reactor gathers other data such as pH, CO2 concentration, and O2 concentration.
