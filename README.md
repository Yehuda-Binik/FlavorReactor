## What is PioReactor
The [PioReactor](https://pioreactor.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopzRdypVKwPxkhtQ_nTdt420zSTZJ2I4rYK8X71vCv_GeDcW3wb) is an affordable bioreactor built on top of a Raspberry Pi. It allows for budget friendly microfermentations using bacteria, yeast, and algea.

## PioReactor Limitations
While PioReactors are excelent for small scale experiments, it is unable to accomodate volumes larger than 35mL. In addition, sensors such as pH sensors, DO sensors, and CO2 sensors are unable to fit inside the PioReactor. The FlavorReactor was built by Corro99 in 2024 to tackle these limitations.
